## Datasets

The dataset can be found either in datasets folder or the zip file. Inside the folder contains dataset being used and generated by the python code.

## Grading Remarks

- 1a not whiskers used
- 1b no good even almost wrong answer given
- 3.g no plots were shown
- 5a: total no. possible inputs is wrong
- 6a: Kfold cross validation related codes are commented without any explanations.




## Question

1. Clarify question 1(f) regarding "Specify the ranges of "temperature" and "population_density" for which the frequency of the data is the highest."

2. Clarify question 1(d) Visualize mean and median of "population_density" for non-'None' "holiday" values in the original dataset.
	- Is the original dataset population_density.csv or population_density_categorical.csv?
	- Visualize mean and median as in original dataset -> goes to barplot and show the whisker for mean and median?

3. Clarify question 3(a) & 3(b):
	- Which need to modified first? as in for the one hot encoding and the time that need to be modified?

4. Clarify, what does question 3 pre (a) part code should we write?

5. 3(d) 
	- which feature should we use? should we use everything or just the date_time?
	- should we choose 2 different sampling methods?
